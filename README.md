# shoppingList.github.io
My first website with actions using javascript!

This website was my first practice in successfully using javascript to alter the DOM (Document Object Model) and hence, modify the underlying html/css.

The website offers a simple shopping list with some pre-added items. Users can perform the following actions on the list:
1. Add more items in the shopping list by entering the iterm name in text field and either clicking the enter button or pressing the enter key.
2. click on the items of the shopping list to strike a line through them.
3. Click on delete button to remove the item from the shopping list
